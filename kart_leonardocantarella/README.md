## Description 

Mario is an healthcare professional working at the Nintendo Cars Garage, 
where players go if they have incidents during the the races.
Every car has a "black box" containing a log in text format with recents events.
The last line has a special code defining the status of the car.
Mario would like to dispatch automatically the cars according to the level of damage indicated in the status in two queues:
- recoverable: cars that can be repaired 
- scrap: cars that need to be demolished

## Challenge
Help Mario implementing a system based of files put in a given directory 
(choose the format, remember to be able to distinguish the status in the last line)
send to Kafka and using Kafka Stream perform a triage and sent to the appropriate topic
Use kafka consumer to show the status of the queues

## Setup
You have to build the gradle stream application before running the containers.
To do so, you have to go into "streams-quickstart-gradle" and run "./gradlew fatJar".
This command will build the application jar that is already mapped in docker compose file
for the stream container.

## Getting started
To start the application, just run "docker-compose up -d" on the root folder of
the project.
You are ready! Put some events into the cars/events.log file following this format:
{"kart":"name","status":"recoverable/scrap"} (remember to leave a blank line at the end of the file).
You should see in the consumers containers these events showing up (you can also check using 
kafa ui on localhost:8080)
To stop the application run "docker-compose down"
